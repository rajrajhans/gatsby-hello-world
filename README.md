# Gatsby-hello-world
This is a small Gatsby website I built following the official Gatsby tutorial to get familiar with GatsbyJS ecosystem. 

#### Learnings - 
* Creating a Gatsby site, understanding features provided by Gatsby
* Gatsby Project Structure
* GraphQL & GraphiQL - an intuitive way to handle data in Gatsby 

#### Conclusion
GatsbyJS is a very good framework that provides all the features provided by React while making it easier to build a static website than it is in ReactJS. Many obstacles that you encounter while building a website in React are solved or are made easier to solve by Gatsby.
